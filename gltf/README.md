# glTF sample models for Castle Game Engine

There are not many models here, because there's a great number of glTF test files inside the Khronos repository:

https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/

Go ahead and open them with Castle Game Engine and view3dscene -- we handle glTF 2.0 (both packed glb and gltf formats), converting glTF materials to X3Dv4 `PhysicalMaterial` nodes, so they look beautifully in CGE and X3D.

Information about Castle Game Engine support for glTF is on https://castle-engine.io/creating_data_model_formats.php .
