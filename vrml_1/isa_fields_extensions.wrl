#VRML V1.0 ascii

# This tests VRML 1.0 "isA" and "fields" features for describing
# non-standard nodes. Using snippets from VRML 1.0 specification.
# Result should be *red* cube.
#
# Note that authors own VRML viewer, view3dscene, doesn't handle isA
# for now, so ExtendedMaterial is simply ignored and the cube has
# default material.

Group {
  # This should be interpreted like a standard Material node
  # with red diffuse color.
  ExtendedMaterial {
    fields [ MFString isA, MFFloat indexOfRefraction,
             MFColor diffuseColor, MFFloat transparency ]
    isA [ "Material" ]

    indexOfRefraction .34
    diffuseColor 1 0 0
  }

  # Specifying isA and fields for standard nodes is allowed.

    fields [ SFFloat width, SFFloat height, SFFloat depth ]
    # isA [ "Cube" ]
