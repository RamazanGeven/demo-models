#VRML V1.0 ascii

# This demonstrates a simple extension to the VRML 1.0 specification
# that is implemented in many VRML 1.0 browsers (because it's comfortable,
# because it's allowed by the VRML 97 specification and because
# it's implemented in many VRML 1.0 browsers (because it's comfortable,
# ...)). So I implemented it in my view3dscene too.
#
# The extension is that you can define multiple root nodes in VRML
# nodes hierarchy (i.e., VRML file does not consists of EXACTLY ONE
# node; it consists of as many VRML nodes as you like (but at least one
# node is required)).
