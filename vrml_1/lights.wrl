#VRML V1.0 ascii

# VRML 1.0 lights demo
# We have three lights : point light (the red one; has position),
# spot light (the blue one; has position AND direction) and
# directional light (green one; has only direction).
#
# We can see the same scene duplicated three times.
# The left one is illuminated by the point light and spot light.
# The middle one is illuminated only by the directional light.
# And the right one is illuminated by all three kinds of lights.
#
# You can use color modulators in view3dscene to view separate lights.
# (view only one color channel). You can also use built-in raytracer
# in view3dscene (use "classic" raytracer for this model)
# to render view of this model with shadows.
