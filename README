VRML 1.0 and 2.0 test suite
----------------------------------------

This is a collection of VRML 1.0 and 2.0 demo and test files.
They are rather simple - they just demonstrate
some nice things that can be achieved with VRML 1.0 and 2.0.
At the beginning of each file you can read some comments explaining what
this file demonstrates and how.

I created those files to test my VRML (and 3DS, OBJ and GEO) viewer
view3dscene, look for it at [http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/].
However, most of them should be properly readable by any VRML 1.0 or 2.0
viewer closely following appropriate VRML specifications.

The exception to the above are files inside kambi_extensions
subdirectiories (vrml_1/kambi_extensions and vrml_2/kambi_extensions).
They may not be readable by other VRML browsers,
they use some specific extensions implemented in view3dscene and my
other programs that deal with VRML (like rayhunter).
See [http://www.camelot.homedns.org/~michalis/kambi_vrml_extensions.php]
for specification of how you can use these extensions.

I am constantly adding more test files to this archive as I'm
implementing more features in view3dscene.

Who made this ?
----------------------------------------

Models:
- vrml_1/instancing.wrl and vrml_1/vrml_spec_sample*.wrl were extracted from
  VRML 1.0 specification [http://www.web3d.org/]

- 3ds/p47d.3ds by Orin Palmer, downloaded from [http://www.3dcafe.com/]
  (from free models section), see attached 3ds/p47d.txt

- Everything else was created by me (Kambi).
  Some models (castle.wrl, house_behind_the_glass_b.wrl,
  transparent_materials.wrl) were created using Blender
  [http://www.blender3d.org/], most of the models were just
  written by hand.

  Note that many models in vrml_2/ were created by translating
  (by hand) appropriate vrml_1/ files. In most cases these
  two versions (VRML 1.0 and 2.0) should render *exactly* the same.

Textures :
- textures/castle/ are from [http://www.jonathanclark.com/],
  those are public domain textures from unfinished game "Golgotha",
- brick031.jpg from [http://www.grsites.com/],
- renifery.jpg - author unknown,
- rest created by Kambi using gimp [http://www.gimp.org/]

Skies in skies/ done with Terragen
[http://www.planetside.co.uk/]. They have rather poor quality ---
I had to resize sky_red_* to 256x256 and convert sky_lake_* to JPEGs
to make them easier to download (original 512x512 PNGs were taking 6 MB !).
