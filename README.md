# Demo VRML / X3D models of Castle Game Engine

A collection of test and demo 3D models (and textures and other media). Useful with Castle Game Engine tools (for example view3dscene, https://castle-engine.io/view3dscene.php ), Many of them follow standard file formats (like VRML / X3D) and as such can be also viewed / edited using other tools.
