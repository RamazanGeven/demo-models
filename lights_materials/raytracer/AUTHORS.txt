"Office" and "Graz"
  are from the collection of models of the RenderPark project:
  http://graphics.cs.kuleuven.be/renderpark/ .
  You can download the scenes collection from
  http://graphics.cs.kuleuven.be/renderpark/download.html
  (go to "HTTP download area" there in case ftp doesn't work).

  The "office" model is also part of MGF Example Scenes:
  http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/scenes.html

  They were converted to VRML 1.0 using
  http://castle-engine.sourceforge.net/kambi_mgf2inv.php

  The license of the original MGF models is unclear,
  but I assume that the models are free to be distributed,
  as they are distributed alongside the MGF, Radiance and RenderPark
  projects, all of which are open-source on liberal licenses.

The "alien" in alien_mirror.blend is a highly modified version of the model
  from www.3dcafe.com section "Free models".
  The license details (as well as original download page) is unfortunately lost in time.

The rest was done by Michalis Kamburelis,
  license: GPL >= 2.
