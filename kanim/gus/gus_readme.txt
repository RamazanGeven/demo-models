Gus was created with Blender, based on the basic Blender tutorial:

I wanted to show here that it's possible to design animation in Blender using
the very comfortable "armature" + insert LocRocSize approach, and then
export it to KAnim.

It is possible, although I admit that it has some quirks ---
because Blender doesn't export animation in any form into VRML
(standard VRML 1.0 doesn't even let Blender to write such thing),
and also it doesn't apply modifiers (such as used subsurf modifier).
This means that the process of exporting requires you to do some work
each time:

gus_1.wrl:
  - open gus.blend
  - go to frame 1
  - go to modifiers panel (press F9 when Gus object is selected)
  - apply every modifier:
    "Make Real" of armature
    "Apply" armature
    "Apply" subsurf
  - then export to gus_1.wrl
gus_2.wrl:
  - *reopen* gus.blend first (or just undo 3 applies done above by Ctrl+Z)
  - go to frame 100
  - go to modifiers panel, apply every modifier like above
  - then export to gus_2.wrl
gus_3.wrl:
  - the same thing, but go to frame 200
