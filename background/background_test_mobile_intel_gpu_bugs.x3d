  <!-- This fails under older drivers for Intel GPU on Windows XP.
    Seems like a specific Background.groundAngle is needed, along with
    any shape in the scene.

    Reported by Jens Spielman, details:
    - Windows XP Professional (5.1, Build 2600) with Service Pack 3
    - HP laptop
    - GPU: OpenGL info:
      Version string: "1.5.0 - Build 7.14.10.4953"
      Vendor: Intel
      Renderer: Intel Cantiga
      Actual GL version (by loading functions) is 1.3, not higher.

    Once disabling VBO rendering it works. It also worked in view3dscne 3.8.0,
    where rendering was with display lists, as opposed to new VBO.

    It also works once graphic drivers were updated from HP.
    New GPU info:
    - Version string: 2.1.0 - Build 6.14.10.5303
    - Vendor: Intel
    - Renderer: Mobile Intel(R) 4 Series Express Chipset Family
