<!--
  Just a testcase of nasty bug corrected one day in Kambi VRML game engine.
  Note that the 1st Coordinate node dictates wrong containerField,
  bug since top-level doesn't use containerField,
  it's reported only on 2nd Coordinate insertion.
  2nd Coordinate insertion fails, since there's no such containerField.

  So this *should* fail, but with proper and clear warning.
