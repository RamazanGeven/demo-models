Many tests here by Victor Amat (thousand thanks!) :
- shadow map tests: original shadow_bias.x3dv
- animated light source for shadow maps: projected_Spotlight.x3dv
- helpers: axes.x3dv.
- old_soft_shadow_poisson_sampling: soft shadows, an adaptation from nVidia SDK 9, but using a PoissonDisk sampler instead of a jittered grid pattern.
