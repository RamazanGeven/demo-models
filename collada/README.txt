humanoid* and cart* files were generated by Blender exporter.

Both these models are also part of "Kambi VRML game engine"
(humanoid --- see "the rift" creature ---
   see ../../rift/data/creatures/humanoid/ if you have checkouted rift sources,
 cart --- see "the castle" gate level ---
   see ../../castle/data/levels/gate/ if you have checkouted castle sources.)

See also warnings/ subdirectory for Collada 1.3.1 versions of these files,
buggy due to old Blender exporter bugs.
