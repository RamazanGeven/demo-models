humanoid* files were generated by Blender exporter from humanoin model
(also part of "Kambi VRML game engine", "the rift" creature --- see
../../rift/data/creatures/humanoid/ if you have checkouted whole sources).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note for 1.3.1 version:

Experience with Blender Collada 1.3.1 exporter shows that it's buggy.
Besides some problems that are detected are fixed by Kambi VRML game engine
(like <accessor> count being wrong), there are also problems that simply
prevent any program to correctly reread these files:

- Matrix version has awfully broken matrices.

  Consider e.g. matrix of "Sphere" object, which should be simple:
  just translation to Z = 1.9. But matrix generated in Collada 1.3.1 file is

    -0.000000 0.000000  1.000000  1.900000
     1.000000 0.000000  0.000000  0.000000
     0.000000 1.000000 -0.000000 -0.000000
    -0.156350 -1.627762 0.000000  1.000000

  which is clearly broken... although 4th column defines some translation with 1.9,
  4th row contains very strange values, and left-upper 3x3 part has "1" in the
  wrong places (they should be only on diagonal, since there's no scale/rotation,
  just like in identity matrix).

  Collada 1.4.1 exporter does correct job, here's what this matrix should look
  like:

      1.0  0.0 0.0 -0.0
      0.0  1.0 0.0 -0.0
     -0.0 -0.0 1.0  1.9
      0.0  0.0 0.0  1.0

- Version without a matrix has also some strange problems. Model looks better,
  but still it looks like rotations are not generated correctly.

IOW, it's not the fault of our engine (or anything else that you may use
to read them) that these models are strangely rendered --- it's the fault
of Blender 1.3.1 exporter, which generated wrong Collada files.
