#VRML V2.0 utf8

# VRML 2.0 lights demo
# We have three lights : point light (the red one; has position),
# spot light (the blue one; has position AND direction) and
# directional light (green one; has only direction).
#
# We can see the same scene duplicated three times.
# The left one is illuminated by the point light and spot light.
# The middle one is illuminated only by the directional light.
# And the right one is illuminated by all three kinds of lights.
#
# You can use color modulators in view3dscene to view separate lights.
# (view only one color channel). You can also use built-in raytracer
# in view3dscene (use "classic" raytracer for this model)
# to render view of this model with shadows.

# VRML 2.0 notes:
# I use "ambientIntensity 1" for evey light to make this look the same
# as VRML 1.0 analogous file. In VRML 1.0 ambientIntensity is taken from
# intensity, and default intensity is 1. In VRML 2.0 default ambientIntensity
# is 0. So lights in VRML 2.0 by default are darker (and usually better-looking,
# actually) than VRML 1.0.
