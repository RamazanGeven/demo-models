#VRML V2.0 utf8

# Inline node tests by Kambi.

# VRML 2 notes: in VRML 1.0 these scale + translation pairs
# were expressed as Scale node followed by Translate node.
# Note that when I have to convert them to Transform node,
# I have to convert each pair to 2 Transform nodes, i.e.
# I cannot use just one Transform { scale 1.2 1.2 1.2 translation +3 0 0 }
# because this would reverse the effects of translation and scaling
# and so results would be different then in analogous VRML 1.0 file.
