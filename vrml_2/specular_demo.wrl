# Simple demo of specular lighting.
# The scene contains one static point light (headlight is turned off
# to see *only* this light).
# Move around on the scene (e.g. strafe left/right and rotate to keep
# focused on the center ball) and you should see that the white specular
# spots on balls move with you. The blue lightened area doesn't change
# (as it's caused by diffuse color).
