# crown.png texture is a demo of texture with simple transparency :
# some pixels of this texture are fully opaque and some are
# fully transparent. (I created crown.png with GIMP,
# http://www.gimp.org)
#
# My program view3dscene does not display properly partial transparency
# with textures (with pixels like "30% opaque 70% transparent") YET.
# (Partial transparency with materials is implemented, see e.g.
# house_behind_the_glass_final.wrl)

# Additional test of transparent material and of view3dscene
# "Write scene bounding box" function  below
