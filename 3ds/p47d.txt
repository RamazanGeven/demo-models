This the P47 Thunderbolt of World War II. It is the first in a
series of WWII aircraft that I am working on. As such, some of
it is a little crude and unfinished, so feel free to touch it
up. I may go ahead and modify it and re-upload it later.

This object is copyrighted by me, Orin Palmer. You may freely
distribute, but please leave this Readme file with it. (everyone
wants to have their moment in the limelight after all)
If you wish to modify it, go ahead and have fun with it. If you
do though, how about uploading your efforts so I can see how it
has evolved.
