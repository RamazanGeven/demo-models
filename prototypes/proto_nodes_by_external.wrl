# Test of EXTERNPROTO handling.
# This is very similar to proto_nodes.wrl test (and in fact should
# produce exactly the same rendering result), but all it's prototypes
# are defined as external and reference proto_nodes.wrl.
#
# Prototype type names deliberately changed to have _Imported suffix,
# to test that EXTERNPROTO determines available name (not actual proto
# name in the external file).
